<h1 align="center">Serelepe Monitoring</h1>
<h1 align="center">[[ UNDER DEVELOPMENT ]]</h1>

## About

Serelepe is entirely written in PHP code, and does not uses any funky ass framework to do its job. It's aimed for simplicity using plugin and dynamic triggers/methods/events.
It talks natively with ProxMox API, that means it can monitor your whole infrastructure containers/VMs without running an agent on every machine.

It is currenlty in development phase, so expect bugs.

## Purpose

A tool where you can write/use your/third party monitoring plugins, extending already present functions/classes.
